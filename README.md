# how you can contribute 

you can contribute to this repository by 
- making a version of this that works for postgres or mysql wich has similar code
- adding some boiler startup for more complex joins (although without a doubt the user will have to modify it, it just gives the user an option to get a quick start)
- extend this idea to making some boiler code for fast api rest api's or any other api framework for that matter


## upcoming 
i have a way to make html forms using python code. once its done we can see about combinding everything all into one tool (have a form for create and updating auto generated)
